git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/axg-camera-store.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to cPanel

```bash
# Build deployment package
./deployment/deploy.sh

# This creates a zip file ready for cPanel upload!
# Upload the generated ZIP to your cPanel File Manager
```

### 3. Configure Backend

- Set up Node.js app in cPanel pointing to `/api` folder
- Copy `.env.production` to `.env` and add your database credentials
- Install npm dependencies and start the app
